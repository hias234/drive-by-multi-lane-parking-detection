# Drive By Multi-lane Parking Detection

This is the implementation of a master thesis at the Johannes Kepler University Linz. The goal is to determine if it is possible to detect parking spaces while driving by only using distance measures to the right side of the road.
The recorded data set can be found in this repository: https://github.com/hias234/drive-by-multi-lane-parking-detection-data/tree/master
